"Your location on a map of the Earth provides the hour hand of a 24 hour "
"clock. By reading the number on the hour ring corresponding to your "
"location, you know what the solar time of your location is. So you are "
"not actually using a clock, but a model of the Earth's rotation, in order"
" to get an idea of the current time."

#: templates/main.html:95
msgid ""
"We divided the time on the watch's face not in 12, but in 24 hours. We "
"then turned the clock's face into a representation of the Earth centered "
"on the South Pole. This way the Earth's map rotates the way the Earth "
"does (seen from above the South Pole, the rotation is clockwise.) Then we"
" set the period of the rotating map's spin: 24 hours exactly. If you are "
"patient enough, you will see that the map gently rotates."

msgid ""
"At this point, the key idea is to find your location on the map. This is "
"done either by entering the location directly in the Latitude and "
"Longitude boxes, or by allowing the software to retrieve your position. "
"You position is then indicated by the red dot."

"Here comes the important part: the way we built it, the red dot does not "

"We added another hand that does take input from a real clock: whereas the"
" red dot specified solar time, the thin hand signals the actual "

"The shaded area represents the night on Earth. The Sun is to be found in "

"Used on Earth, a clock does not only tell the time, it also tells what "
"meridian you are on (modulo time zones). For instance, it tells you that "
"it is noon now. And now it is noon in Paris. Hence the clock tells you "
"that you are on the Paris meridian. In order to draw this conclusion from"
" the fact that is noon now, the only thing you have to know is that it is"
" now noon in Paris."

"Accordingly, a clock can misinform you about your location. It tells you "
"that it is noon now. And now it is noon in Paris. The clock tells you "
"that you are on the Paris meridian. But you are actually in London. It is"
" 11am in London. If at 11am you look at you clock in London and it tells "
"that it is noon, you may philosophically claim that the clock is not "
"misinforming you, as it is telling what time it is now in Paris. But in "
"your less philosophical moments, you would claim that the clock is plain "
"wrong. Because it tells you that you are on the Paris meridian, and you "
"know you are in London."

"Consider a 24 hours dial. In place of the marks for 12 hours, it has "
"marks for 24 hours. Make it a bit more complex. Instead of the hour hand,"
" a miniature map of the globe as projected from the South pole occupies "
"the whole of the clock's face. In the projection (an azimuthal "
"equidistant projection), the South Pole is at the center of the face, and"
" the North Pole is degenerately represented by the outmost circumference."
" Meridians are represented by straight lines, i.e. rays emanating from "
"the center; parallels are concentric circles. The miniature map slowly "
"revolves clockwise around the center, coming full circle in 24 hours. "
"Abstract from time zones, with their irregular shapes and quantizing "

"Have the movement set relative to a standard of time, for instance by "

" now the time you read on the dial, and you'll know where you are. "
"Suppose your position is given by a GPS and translated on the revolving "
"miniature map by a red dot. The number you'll read at the end of the "
"meridian on which the red dot lies is your current time. Take away the "
"map, just leaving the red dot and the meridian. This is almost an "
"ordinary clock's hour hand. In an ordinary (24 hours) clock, you just "
"cannot see the map behind the meridian. But the map is there – and the "
"hand is just a meridian on that map: your meridian."

"An Azimuthal Equidistant Projection is mounted on a 24-hour clock face. "
"The hour hand is replaced by an indicator of the current position of the "
"clock (the \"red dot\"). Centering the projection on the South Pole "
"aligns the clockwise spin's direction of the Earth (as seen from the "
"South Pole) with the traditional clockwise movement of the clock's hand. "
"The same projection could be mounted on the face of an equatorial sundial"
" set for the Southern hemisphere."

"Perfectly working clocks can fail to tell the time. If you are at the "
"South Pole, the red dot is at the center of the clock's face. It lies on "
"every meridian. If you are at the North Pole, the red dot spreads and "
"occupies the outer circumference; there too it lies on every meridian. "
"Fair enough: at the North and the South Pole it does not make sense to "
"ask for the hour. Two travelers heading north from different starting "
"points who meet at the North Pole could only observe the differences "
"between the readings of their clocks. Their clocks at the poles only "
"indicate the direction they are coming from; they only contain spatial "
"information."

"A sundial whose stylus coincides with the North (or the South) Pole and "
"is parallel to the Earth's axis just indicates where on Earth it is now "
"midnight, by pointing its shadow towards a meridian. On each point on "
"that meridian it is now midnight (and of course, at some of those places "
"a midnight sun shines)."

#: templates/main.html:132
msgid ""
"Many complaints have been addressed to the Northern bias in geographic "
"representation: in most maps, North is up, South is down. The "
"Chronogeoscope is centered on the South pole, because when seen from "
"above the South Pole, the Earth spins clockwise, and we wanted to keep "
"the clockwise analogy with ordinary clocks. Had we centered it on the "
"North Pole, we would have displayed a counterclockwise rotation. The "
"clockwise constraint and the use of the Azimuthal Equidistant Projection "
"allow us to explore a Southern Perspective on geographic representation. "
"In the Chronogeoscope we simply get rid of the up-down couple and replace"
" it with the center/periphery couple: South is at the center, and North "
"is everywhere at the periphery (remember, the North Pole is to be found "
"at the end of each meridian, and as all meridians radiate from the South "
"Pole, the North Pole is everywhere on the outer border of the map.)"

"The Cronogeoscope is a slow educational device. It spins at the angular "
"speed of the Earth, (15°/hour), thus your vision can't tell that it "
"moves. You have to wait and use your memory to realize the change. Sure "
"enough, the general trend is towards optimizing learning time (\"the "
"quicker, the better\"); unfortunately we cannot offer time shortcuts here"
" (of course you can shot a time lapse of the web page.) Here is a "
"suggestion for educators: display it in the morning, when class begins. "
"Then go back to it later in the day. Compare it with the movement of an "
"ordinary clock - that spins twice as fast. Take screenshots and post them"
" to the walls."
